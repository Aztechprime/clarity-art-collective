# Art Collective Ownership Contract

A blockchain-based solution for managing collective art ownership rights. This contract enables:

- Artists to register their artwork and divide ownership into shares

The system provides a transparent and decentralized way to manage fractional ownership of artwork, enabling broader participation in art investment and collective ownership.

## Royalty System

The contract now includes an automated royalty distribution system that:
- Allows artists to set royalty percentages when registering artwork
- Automatically calculates and transfers royalty payments during share transfers
