# Art Collective Ownership Contract

A blockchain-based solution for managing collective art ownership rights. This contract enables:

- Artists to register their artwork and divide ownership into shares
- Transfer of ownership shares between users
- Tracking of artwork details and ownership distribution
- Verification of share ownership

The system provides a transparent and decentralized way to manage fractional ownership of artwork, enabling broader participation in art investment and collective ownership.
